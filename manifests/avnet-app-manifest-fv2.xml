    <description><![CDATA[This code example demonstrates implementing an MQTT Client using the MQTT Client library. The library uses the AWS IoT device SDK Port library and implements the glue layer that is required for the library to work with Infineon&#8482; connectivity platforms. This example can be ported to CM0+ core using a make variable CORE from Makefile.
    <br><br>For more details, see the <a href="https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-mqtt-client/blob/master/README.md">README on GitHub</a>.
